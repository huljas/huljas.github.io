I wanted to monitor our Spring MVC application with <a href="http://jamonapi.sourceforge.net/">Jamon</a>. We rely on the use of the <code>@Controller</code> annotation so aspects seemed like the right way to go. 

After some digging on the <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.6.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-pointcuts-designators">documentation</a> I came up with the following aspect:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1600772.js?file=MonitoredSpringBeanAspect.java"></script>

Now I just needed to enable autoproxying with 

bc. <aop:aspectj-autoproxy />

line in my application context file and all my controllers started showing in Jamon!
