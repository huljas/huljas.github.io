I got challenged to the "unshredder":http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder challenge. I decided to try something different this time and try to solve the problem with *python*.

h3. Setting up

So my first task was to setup python and the "PIL":http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ image library on my windows machine. I had python installed but the PIL installer couldn't find it, so I had reinstall python. After that I did a quick check:

bc. >>> from PIL import Image
>>> quit()

No errors so I was ready to go!

h3. Learning python as you code

I had used python a bit earlier but honestly *too little*. So this was a nice chance to learn some more. Luckily they had some sample code to get started with. 

After fixing some syntax issues from my copy-paste, I had a the example program running and producing the image seen below!

h3. First solution

It took me 2-3 hours to get the *image unshredded*.

I used the nice "python tutorial":http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html a lot and getting used to the syntax took a while <em>(no semicolons! no curly braces!)</em>. But I found python to be really easy and powerful language! 

Here's the solution, not very elegant but pretty readable IMO ;).

h3. Better solution

I'll update this once I tweak my solution.
