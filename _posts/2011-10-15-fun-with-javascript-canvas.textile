$(function() {
  Animation.init("stars1");  
});
</script>

I had this *crazy* idea of putting some canvas animation into the layout of this new site. The idea didn't fly, but I managed to create this *quite nice* animation of stars:

<canvas id="stars1" width="660" height="300" style="border: 3px solid #999;">
</canvas>

Here's the code:
